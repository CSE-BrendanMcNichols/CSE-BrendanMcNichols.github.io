                    <p>I implemented JavaScript conditionals to create dynamic, interactive web elements. The webpage includes a color slider, where the background color changes based on the slider value using an if statement to determine the RGB values. Additionally, I created a picture chooser feature that dynamically displays different images based on user input, using conditionals to select the appropriate image size.</p>

                    <p>I created an interactive and responsive webpage that showcases a variety of ice cream flavors. The page connects to an external JSON file using async/await to dynamically load and display the ice cream flavors and images.

                    <p>For this assignment, I created a simple "Hello World" server application.
